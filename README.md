# Run experiments for the active learning visualization project

run `./run_examples.py` to create the prediction values and test samples for the CASP experiment.

# Original paper: Active Learning for Non-Parametric Regression Using Purely Random Trees

Algorithms and experiments for NeurIPS paper "Active Learning for Non-Parametric Regression 
Using Purely Random Trees" available at:
https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7520-active-learning-for-non-parametric-regression-using-purely-random-trees.pdf

Built with Python 3.5.2. Requires Numpy to run experiments but only base Python to run the 
algorithms themselves. 

To see experiments from the paper use the script run_examples.py. In order to change parameters of the algorithm 
change within the respective example_* script.
